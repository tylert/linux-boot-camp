Welcome
=======

If you are new to Raspberry Pi and/or Linux and would like some help getting it
installed and working, there are local experts available to help you.

You may visit https://eventbrite.ca/event/16372002099 to help give the
organizers an idea of roughly how many intend to attend this event.  This is a
free event and it is open to anyone and everyone.

The organizers would very much like to thank `Algonquin College`_ for the use
of their space, equipment, electricity and internet access and also the
volunteer members of the non-profit `Ottawa Canada Linux Users' Group`_
(OCLUG_) for donating their time and expertise without which we would not be
able to offer such an event.
