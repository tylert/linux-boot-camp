Welcome
=======

If you are new to Raspberry Pi and/or Linux and would like some help getting it
installed and working, there are local experts available to help you.

You may visit https://eventbrite.ca/event/16372002099 to help give the
organizers an idea of roughly how many intend to attend this event.  This is a
free event and it is open to anyone and everyone.

The organizers would very much like to thank `Algonquin College`_ for the use
of their space, equipment, electricity and internet access and also the
volunteer members of the non-profit `Ottawa Canada Linux Users' Group`_
(OCLUG_) for donating their time and expertise without which we would not be
able to offer such an event.

When and Where
--------------

We will have an Info Desk set up outside **Room T119** at Algonquin College.

| Saturday, May 23, 2015 from 0900h to 1600h (Eastern Time)
| Algonquin College, Woodroffe Campus, Building T, 1st Floor

More detailed directions may be found on our `How To Get There
<how_to_get_there.html>`__ page.

* **Raspberry Pi** or other Linux computer (if you have one already)

If you wish to make a donation to the `Algonquin Students' Association Food
