Volunteer Info
==============

If you are planning to volunteer your Linux expertise at this event, thank you.

What you need to do
-------------------

If you are volunteering, you would ideally show up an hour before the event is
supposed to begin.

Stuff to bring
--------------

It would be very helpful if you could try to also bring **minimum one** of each
of the following items with you to the event:

* HDMI display with power cord and HDMI cable
* microUSB power adapter (5VDC @ 2A)
* USB mouse and keyboard
* CAT5-ish network cable
* microSD and SD card (plus card adapters if needed)

The intention is that you would have all the stuff needed to work on **one or
two** Raspberry Pi units at a time and be able to reflash microSD and SD cards.
