Volunteer Info
==============

If you are planning to volunteer your Linux expertise at this event, thank you.

Stuff to bring
--------------

It would be very helpful if you could try to bring the following items with you
to the event:

* **laptop or similar portable machine** capable of being used to reflash images
* microSD and SD card adapters to allow for reflashing of Raspbian images
* blank 1GB or larger USB drive suitable for booting an Ubuntu installer
* spare HDMI display with power cord and HDMI cable
* spare microUSB power supply (5VDC @ 2A)
* spare USB mouse and keyboard
* spare CAT5-ish network cable
* spare AC power cable (in case someone lugs in a desktop)

The intention is that you would have all the stuff needed to work on a
Raspberry Pi unit or BeagleBone or other similar recent Linux machine.

If you prefer to work in small teams and share equipment, that will probably be
fine as well.

What to do the day of the event
-------------------------------

Please show up **one hour** before the event is supposed to begin.
