Volunteer Info
==============

If you are planning to volunteer your Linux expertise at this event, thank you.


Stuff to bring
--------------

It would be very helpful if you could try to bring the following items with you
to the event:

* **laptop or similar portable machine** capable of being used to reflash images
* microSD and SD card adapters to allow for reflashing of Raspbian images
* blank 1GB or larger USB drive suitable for booting an Ubuntu installer
* spare HDMI display with power cord and HDMI cable
* spare microUSB power supply (5VDC @ 2A)
* spare USB mouse and keyboard
* spare CAT5-ish network cable
* spare AC power cable (in case someone lugs in a desktop)

If you prefer to work in small teams and share equipment, that will probably be
fine as well.  We are hoping that some of this stuff may be borrowed from one
of the labs there but it would be very helpful if you could still try to bring
stuff anyway to try to ensure there aren't any gaps.

A lot of laptops have built-in SD card readers.  This might allow you to write
to both the full-size SD cards used in older generation Raspberry Pi units as
well as microSD cards for the newer generation Raspberry Pi units using a
microSD to SD adapter.

What to do the day of the event
-------------------------------

The intention is that you would have available all the stuff needed to work on
a Raspberry Pi unit or BeagleBone or other similar recent Linux machine.  You
may be asked to assist with reinstallation, booting, general startup or other
related tasks.

When you get there, talk to the nice folks at the `Info Desk`_ to determine
where you can set up your equipment.  When you are ready to accept your first
"customer", just mention it to the folks at the Info Desk and they can attempt
to direct some folks over to you for help.

We can't guarantee exactly when our "customers" plan to show up but it seems
likely that the bulk of them are likely to show up before noon.  The event will
run for about 8 hours to allow for some flexibility in terms of how long it
might take to help folks, time for breaks and delays in their arrival times.
