<h1>Volunteer Info</h1>
<p>If you are planning to come out and volunteer your Linux expertise at this
event, thank you.  If you would like to help us plan out this event, we have
started a <a class="reference external" href="http://goo.gl/forms/qwVNy8H8ns">Volunteer Sign-Up Form</a> to try to simplify all the organizing of
stuff.</p>
<p>If you would like to demo stuff or present something, we please ask that you
submit your proposal using the form above so that we can try to plan a suitable
timeslot for you.  Of course, we also won't try to dissuade you if you want to
come hang out with us all day long.</p>
<div class="section" id="stuff-to-bring">
<h2>Stuff to bring</h2>
<p>It would be very helpful if you could try to bring the following items with you
to the event:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>laptop or similar portable machine</strong> capable of being used to reflash images</li>
<li>microSD and SD card adapters to allow for reflashing of Raspbian images</li>
<li>blank 1GB or larger USB drive suitable for booting an Ubuntu installer</li>
<li>microUSB power supply (5VDC &#64; 2A)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some displays, cables, keyboards and mice will be borrowed from the labs.
However, bringing your own will certainly be very helpful to ensure there's
enough to go around.  If you prefer to work in small teams and share equipment,
that will be ok too.</p>
<p>A lot of laptops have built-in SD card readers.  This might allow you to write
to both the full-size SD cards used in older generation Raspberry Pi units as
well as microSD cards for the newer generation Raspberry Pi units using a
microSD to SD adapter.</p>

far right for comparison.  Image from wikimedia.org.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-to-do-the-day-of-the-event">
<h2>What to do the day of the event</h2>
<p>The intention is that you would have available all the stuff needed to work on
a Raspberry Pi unit or BeagleBone or other similar recent Linux machine.  You
may be asked to assist with reinstallation, booting, general startup or other
related introductory-type questions.  You may certainly do whatever you are
comfortable doing and/or call upon the assistance of your fellow Linux gurus.</p>
<p>When you get there, talk to the nice folks at the <a class="reference external" href="how_to_get_there.html">Info Desk</a> to determine
where you can set up your equipment.  When you are ready to accept your first
&quot;customer&quot;, just mention it to the folks at the Info Desk and they can attempt
to direct some folks over to you for help.</p>
<p>We can't guarantee exactly when our &quot;customers&quot; plan to show up but it seems
likely that the bulk of them are likely to show up before noon.  The event will
run for about 8 hours to allow for some flexibility in terms of how long it
might take to help folks, time for breaks and delays in their arrival times.</p>
